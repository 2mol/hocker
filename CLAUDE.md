# Hocker Project Context

## Project Goal
Create a mini webapp similar to skapa that displays a 3D model exported from Fusion 360 (export happens once, then we display it in the webapp with the IKEA manual aesthetic).

## Project Structure
- `/skapa/` - Reference codebase from Nicolas Mattia (DO NOT MODIFY)
  - A parametric 3D printing app for IKEA SKÃ…DIS
  - Uses Three.js, Manifold-3d, and Vite
  - TypeScript setup with Twrl for JSX

## Tech Stack (Based on skapa)
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.7
- **3D Rendering**: Three.js 0.173
- **3D Operations**: Manifold-3d 3.0
- **3D Export**: @jscadui/3mf-export
- **UI**: Twrl (JSX)
- **Compression**: fflate

## Development Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run tsc` - TypeScript type checking
- `npm run build` - Production build
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier

## Key Features to Implement
- Display 3D model exported from Fusion 360
- IKEA manual-style rendering (outline shader, thickened lines)
- 3D model viewer with rotation controls
- Export to 3MF format for 3D printing

## Development Principles
**ALWAYS FOLLOW KISS/YAGNI**
- Keep It Simple, Stupid - Don't overcomplicate
- You Aren't Gonna Need It - Don't add features that aren't needed
- Example: No animations/rotations unless specifically requested
- Build only what's asked for, nothing more

## Notes
- Keep skapa folder untouched as reference
- Build new webapp with identical dependencies and setup
- Model is exported from Fusion 360 once, then displayed in webapp
- Focus on IKEA manual aesthetic rendering using shaders from skapa
